## Core Features

### 1. Automated Image Layout System
- **Input:** Users upload images in common formats (PNG, JPEG, TIFF, PDF).
- **Automatic Layout:**  
  - **Business Cards:** Arrange 9Ã—5 cm cards optimally on A4 or A3 sheets with 3mm bleed per card.
  - **Double-sided Support:** Generate properly aligned back sheets with horizontal mirroring for duplex printing.
  - **Canvas Wraps:** Allow wrap-around layouts (e.g., A3 canvas with 3.5 cm bleed per side, print on A2).
  - **Smart Fitting:** Automatic calculation of cards per sheet and total sheets needed.
- **No Design Tools Required:** Template selection, options, and image upload only.

### 2. Professional Print Export
- **Output:** 300dpi, CMYK, print-ready PDFs with proper cut marks.
- **Features:** 
  - Correct sheet sizing with professional margins
  - Bleed handling for trim-safe printing
  - Cut marks and registration marks
  - Optimized for offset and digital printing

### 3. Modular & Extensible Architecture
- Component-based structure for easy addition of new print products.
- Reusable layout calculation functions.
- Standardized PDF generation pipeline.
- Internal use only - no authentication or order management.
